# TBS_App

Trauma Bay Decision App
A web based application that serves as a decision support tool for the clinical team during any
given trauma. The user will be able to check off various steps of the Primary Survey as well as
input critical patient vitals. Based on user input, various critical alerts will pop up on the 
summary page. These alerts serve both as way to indicate critical steps in the various protocols and
to suggest any next steps the team should take. Additionally, the total time elapsed since the
beginning of the trauma will be displayed on both the main page as well as the summary page.
